<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D student of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong.

My research interest includes load forecasting, multi-energy systems, and data sharing in energy systems. I have published more than 11 journal papers (10 in English, 1 in Chinese) with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZxFQboUAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>xxxx+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZxFQboUAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
