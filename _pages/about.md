<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D candidate of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong.

My research interest includes load forecasting, multi-energy systems, and data sharing in energy systems. I have published 11 journal papers (10 in English, 1 in Chinese) with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZxFQboUAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>288, H index=8</span></strong></a>.
